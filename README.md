# Repository developed for training purposes. 

This repository is developed to give a low level introduction to timeseries. Based on a series theorie about what's important to explore and choose, based on two easy to understand models. What's important to know is that there is a underlying presentation which is not included into this repository.

The notebook 'Forecasting.ipynb' is used to get an introduction into timeseries.
